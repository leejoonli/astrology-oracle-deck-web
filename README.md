# Application Description
This application is a simple virtual representation of an astrology oracle deck, based on a real life version that I cannot find.  It only offers a three card spread and basic functionality and aesthetics.

Special thanks to my friend, Danielle Garratt, for most of the artwork.

## Technologies Used
- Typescript
- React

## Installation Instructions
<!-- You will need to download this application to view it using the QR code reader.

1. Visit this link: https://expo.dev/@leejoonli/astrology-oracle-deck.
2. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go App.
4. Enjoy the application.

I do not recommend trying to clone this repository and running it locally because it is a bit of a nuisance but if you're intent on doing so you can follow the instructions below.

### React Native Environment
1. In your terminal run `npm install -g expo-cli`.  This will globally install the Expo CLI.
2. Install the Expo Go app on your phone.
3. After installing expo, follow the GitHub installation below.  After you finish the Github Installation steps, move onto step 4.
4. Run `npm start`. If your app isn't building try and run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` first.
5. You should see a QR code that you can use your Expo app for.
6. After reading the QR code with Expo, you should be directed to the application.

## Current Application State

### Home Page
There will be a "spead" of cards that appear at the top of the screen that you will then tap and will display three randomly chosen cards.

### Card Meaning Modal

When you tap on one of the cards, a modal will appear that displays the card information.

## Future Improvements

- It would be interesting to add more animations to make the application more interactive.
- Adding an option for more than a three card spread.
- Potentially introducing the idea of different kinds of decks.

\*Note: After deployment, there will be very little to no updates to this repository.  It will essentially become deprecated starting in June 2022.

## Initial Planning

### Project Idea
This application is a simple virtual representation of an astrology oracle deck.  This project is a gift for a friend of mine since she likes card readings.

### Tech Stack
- React
- Typescript

\*Note: This project could have a backend database to hold all the card information but I feel it is unnecessary and will probably have the data in another file and export it to whatever components I need it in.

### User Stories
MVP
- As a user, I want to be able to tap the deck section so I can randomly choose the cards from the deck.
- As a user, I want to be able to not choose the same card/s so I can have an accurate reading.
- As a user, I want to be able to tap on the selected cards so I can understand what each card represents.
- As a user, I want to be able decide if I want another reading so I can ask more questions.

STRECH GOALS
- As a user, I want to be able to choose how many cards I want to pull from the deck so I can get a more detailed reading.
